As my TrueNas is virtualized inside of xcp-ng and for some VM and install isos shares I'm using shares from this nas, standart autostart is not working on VMs using these remote storages as they won't autorecennect after server reboot.
to overcome this issue I created script and calling it from /etc/rc.local

To find remote storage that needs to be reconnected, run:
xe pbd-list

in the output we can see not connected storage, note the uuid.

in the script for every remote that needs to be reconnected add line:
xe pbd-plug uuid=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx

then add for every VM dependant on reote storage following line (you can use xe vm-list to find-out the VM's uuid)
xe vm-start uuid=yyyyyyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyyyyyyyyyy

add correct permisions:
chmod +x script
